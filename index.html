                <p> Hello and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Joshua Joseph and I am currently going through a web development bootcamp through Northwestern University. It's still within the first two weeks, but I am happy to finally persue a career in this field in a few short months. Before this class I knew HTML and CSS. I am looking forward into learning other things to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Javascript</li>
                        <li>JQuery</li>
                        <li>Ruby on Rails</li>
                        <li>Python</li>
                        <li>MySQL</li>
                        <li>SEO</li>
                        <li>BootStrap</li>
                        <li>And many others!</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p>What do I like to do in my spare time, though? Video games, of course. I have been in a top 200 world raiding guild for World of Warcraft, but have retired from that scene. I have also become a grandmaster level player in Blizzard's other game: Overwatch. In World of Warcraft I played a warlock for about 7 years and in Overwatch, I main flex support, which means that I play characters like Moira, Zenyatta, and now Brigitte. If I am not playing video games I am teaching myself how to play piano, which I can't wait to explore more.</p>
